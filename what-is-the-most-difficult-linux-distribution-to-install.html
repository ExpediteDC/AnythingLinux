        <p>When selecting a Linux Distro for a Beginner, you should go with the simplest option. However, veterans of the Linux Community are far more knowledgeable about this element of Linux. If you are unfamiliar with Linux. Linux is a kernel, and users can create an operating system on top of it. With its comparable appearance to Windows, Linux Mint is a popular choice for beginners. Now people like to overly-customize their OS/Distrobution and thats what Archlinux, Gentoo And LFS (Linux from scratch)</p>
<p><img alt="ArchLinux" src="./images/archlinux.png#mid" title="archlinux icon"></p>
<h2>What is Arch Linux?</h2>
<p><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> is a lightweight Linux distribution that is highly customisable. It is well-known for its rolling releases and up-to-date packages. Arch Linux also strives to keep things simple and encourages the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) concept.</p>
<p>To install Arch Linux, you must use a manual installation method that allows for a highly customized system. Making a bootable USB stick, booting into the Arch Linux live environment, partitioning your disk, and then installing and customizing the base system through the command-line interface are all part of the installation process.</p>
<p>The official Arch Linux installation guide includes step-by-step instructions for installing the distribution. The installation guide may be found on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">Arch Wiki</a>, which is a great resource for Arch Linux users.</p>
<p>Remember that installing Arch Linux takes some technical knowledge and can be more difficult than installing other beginner-friendly variants. However, it provides an excellent learning opportunity and gives you complete control over your system settings.</p>
<p>Feel free to visit the <a href="https://archlinux.org">Official Website</a> of Archlinux for more info.</p>
<h2>What about Gentoo?</h2>
<p><img alt="Gentoo" src="./images/gentoo.png#mid" title="gentoo icon"></p>
<p><a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> is well-known for its complication, both in terms of system setup and installation. The complexity arises from the company's concept of allowing users entire control over their system, as well as the requirement to assemble applications from source code.</p>
<p>Gentoo's installation process is lengthy and involves a large amount of manual tweaking. It starts with downloading a minimal installation image and installing the essential system components. Users can then personalize their installation by customizing various components such as the kernel, device drivers, network settings, and system services manually. This level of flexibility enables fine-grained customization, but it also necessitates a thorough mastery of Linux fundamentals and system management.</p>
<p>Gentoo's package management system, Portage, adds another degree of complication. Portage is based on a sophisticated system of dependency computations and USE flags, which are compile-time options that decide whether or not specific features in software packages are included or excluded. This level of customisation provides a tremendous deal of versatility, but users must navigate and handle these flags efficiently.</p>
<p>The Gentoo community offers substantial documentation and tools to help users with installation and configuration. Gentoo, on the other hand, is frequently considered more ideal for experienced Linux users and enthusiasts who appreciate the task of constructing and optimizing their system from scratch due to the extremely manual nature of the installation and the requirement for in-depth expertise.</p>
<h2>What is the hardest Distro?</h2>
<p>When it comes to difficulty, both Gentoo Linux and Arch Linux have a reputation for being sophisticated and tough distributions. However, there is another distribution that outperforms both in terms of complexity - Linux from Scratch (LFS).</p>
<p>In terms of customization and manual configuration, Gentoo Linux and Arch Linux are identical. The Gentoo installation procedure involves users to generate software from source, which necessitates a thorough understanding of Linux fundamentals. Arch Linux takes a basic approach, with users starting with a minimum installation image and manually configuring components.</p>
<p>But then there's Linux from Scratch, a distribution that focuses on creating a Linux system entirely from source code, starting with nothing more than a rudimentary toolchain. LFS provides users with step-by-step instructions, requiring them to methodically assemble each package and setup the system. This procedure necessitates a thorough understanding of Linux internals and is regarded as an advanced endeavor for seasoned Linux enthusiasts.</p>
<p>While Gentoo and Arch give some convenience and predefined components, Linux from Scratch provides a thorough education in Linux internals at the expense of higher complexity and a substantially longer installation process.</p>
<p>Finally, while both Gentoo Linux and Arch Linux bring their own hurdles, Linux from Scratch pushes complexity to a new level, making it the genuine champion of complexity in Linux. </p>

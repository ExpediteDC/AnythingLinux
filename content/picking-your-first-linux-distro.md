Linux has a wide range of distributions, each with its own set of capabilities and characteristics. Finding the proper distribution can have a huge impact on a beginner's first encounter with Linux. In this post, we give a curated list of Linux distributions suitable for beginners, with user-friendly interfaces, rich documentation, and active community support. These distributions provide a solid foundation for your Linux adventure, whether you're new to Linux or looking for a smooth move from another operating system.

## But first, What's a Distro?

A Linux distribution, sometimes known as a "distro," is a full operating system based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is the operating system's fundamental component that interacts with hardware and handles system resources. A kernel, on the other hand, is insufficient for a functional operating system. To provide a comprehensive and useful computer environment, a Linux distribution integrates the Linux kernel with a variety of software packages such as utilities, libraries, graphical interfaces, and applications.

The philosophy of Linux comes from the rules of open source, freedom and collaboration. It supports/encouraging sharing and modification of software. Linux has a welcoming community where developers collaborate, contribute and share their knowledge and support to one another. It values the freedom to customize and the transparency that It has, and because of this made a big technological advancement.
